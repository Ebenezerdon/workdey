# Guidelines for taskers

To ensure that you have the possible best that workdey has to offer, please ensure that you follow adhere to the following:

* Always be detailed in the description of a task. This will help the taskees determine if they are the right fit for the task.
* Include pictures if it helps give a more accurate description of the task.
* Always communicate effectively with the taskee.
* Be clear in your dealings with the taskee, make sure to let the taskee know if you plan to cover transport costs and purchases made for you.
* Always uphold your side of the deal with an assigned taskee, commit to getting the task done with an assigned taskee.
* Note that you are charged when you assign a task to a taskee and the cash is only given to the taskee once you mark a task as done.
